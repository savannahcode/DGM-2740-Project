                For my DGM 1230 class we were instructed to find a non-profit
                website that needs some work and redesign it. I am personally
                passionate about the importance of mental and physical health. I
                know exercise and proper nutrition helps people feel better in
                life in ever way. Ironically, I am staying up all night to
                finish this website, but that's besides the point haha.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because I am passionate about building healthy habits I found a
                non-profit site that seemed it could do a great deal of good,
                yet needed a revamp. The site I decided is for an organization
                called "Action For Healthy Kids" and
                <a href="https://www.actionforhealthykids.org/#">here</a> is the
                link to their site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some issues I found were that the site was very overwhelming,
                many links didn't work, the site wasn't as responsive as I would
                like, and the navigation was very confusing and problematic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Above take a look at the screenshots of the site at first
                glance, and the site navigation.
