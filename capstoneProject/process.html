                For my DGM 1230 class we were instructed to find a non-profit
                website that needs some work and redesign it. I am personally
                passionate about the importance of mental and physical health. I
                know exercise and proper nutrition helps people feel better in
                life in ever way. Ironically, I am staying up all night to
                finish this website, but that's besides the point haha.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because I am passionate about building healthy habits I found a
                non-profit site that seemed it could do a great deal of good,
                yet needed a revamp. The site I decided is for an organization
                called "Action For Healthy Kids", aka AFHK, and
                <a href="https://www.actionforhealthykids.org/#">here</a> is the
                link to their site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some issues I found were that the site was very overwhelming,
                many links didn't work, the site wasn't as responsive as I would
                like, and the navigation was very confusing and problematic.
              </p>
              <img
                src="images/overwhelmingSite.png"
                alt="overwhelming AFHK site"
              />
              <img src="images/siteNav.png" alt="site AFHK navigation" />
              <p>
                Above take a look at the screenshots of the site at first
                glance, and the site navigation. Pretty confusing and
                overwhlming right? To organize my understanding of how to best
                reorganize the AFHK site I created a drawn sitemap of where all
                the links led to and were organized. See below for visual.
              </p>
              <img src="images/drawn-sitemap.png" alt="drawn sitemap" />
              <p>
                Next, I created wireframe sketches of how I wanted to layout the
                information for the organization in a simpler, more concise way.
                I wanted the site to be cute and kid-friendly, yet still
                engaging for adults. I didn't design for every single route that
                the AFHK site had, especially considering some of the links led
                nowhere, but I trired to include the basic beginnings of what
                would be necessary for the site to be less confusing on first
                view and click.
              </p>

              <img src="images/wireframe-sketch2.png" alt="wireframe sketch" />
              <p>
                After that I created basic digital wireframes to make more clear
                what I wanted the site to be online, rather than just on paper.
                To start, I kept the wireframe in black and white to focus on
                the layout, rather than the color scheme. These wireframes were
                created for the 3 difference media query sizes: mobile, tablet,
                and desktop.
              </p>
              <img
                src="images/digital-wireframes.png"
                alt="digital wireframes"
              />
              <p>
                Finall, I created a pattern library, a final wireframe, and a
                prototype that would allow you to simulate if the website were
                coded using Adobe XD's prototype feature!
              </p>

              <img src="images/final-wireframe.png" alt="final wireframe" />
              <p>
                In the end I coded parts of the site, but adjusted to meet the
                requirements of the final capstone assignment for my DGM 2740
                Class.
